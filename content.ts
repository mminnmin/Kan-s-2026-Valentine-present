But the idea pops up when I was showering I guess + you did ask we where I go. Like there’s not many chance for us two to be together with just only us. That’s why. I didn’t think it was fast or slow, at that point I just thought of how cute it would be if we watch the movie together. And it is indeed so CUTE!🥰 Oh, and the Kareoke photo was the first time you text me - I love you - 😳",

It was the first day we hold hands too! On the way to the movie as you can see in the photo. Bby we kissed!! (About 10 seconds before the movie ends) but do you wanna sleep or do you wanna study? Or do you wanna continue what we left off in the movie.. “You suggested a better option” Exact words (proud face)",

Thank you for being you, and for choosing me everyday. From the first day until now, U only make me happy. There are some sad times (like when u gone for half a day) but it’s ok bby. I know my boyfriend got duties and alot of responsibilities. I understand and I will wait patiently to hug you at the end of every day (except long distance).",
      "Long distance, I will wait to hug you the next time we meet. Which is what I’m doing right now. We will be in fights but we will get through it together. It’s not that hard since I know u’re a 24 turning 25 year old man. You made me laugh so much I wanna just pinch ur cheek. Mun keaw woiiiii. As I said on Christmas, please smile alot (because it’s so cute) and take care of your self cuz I dont want you to be sick. You made my life infinitely better, and I will try to make ur’s better tooooo.",
      "Happy Happy Happy Valentine’s day. I’m glad to be spending holidays with you now and will be forever. What a good sentence to type. The is no place I rather be than by ur side. You are the safest place I could be. I feel warm in your arms. It rhymes hahahahha. Btw this shit kinda hard. Well it wouldn’t tale me this long to do it if I didn’t accidentally delete everything when I was almost finished. But yeah, I did it! I hope you like it bby. I try to put music and sound effects in but it doesn’t work, I spent 2 hours on it and still… ok I’ll stop complaining. Please know that I love you, and I will always do. Give me big hugs. I know I have more words for you but let’s keep it for the next holiday.",
